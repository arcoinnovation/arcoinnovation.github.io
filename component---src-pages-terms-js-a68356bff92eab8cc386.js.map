All orders are subject to Arco Innovation’s approval and acceptance. A written acknowledgement sent to Buyer by email with confirmation of payment shall constitute Arco Innovation’s acceptance.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order prior to delivery. For example, if there are errors on the Site or made in connection with your order, inaccuracies in Product or pricing information or Product availability, we reserve the right to correct the error and charge you the correct price or cancel your order. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order. We will contact you if any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>7. CANCELLATION.</strong> No order accepted by Arco Innovation will be subject to cancellation, termination, suspension, change, reduction, cutback or any modifications by Buyer except with Arco Innovation's prior written consent, which may be subject to fees as Arco Innovation determines.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>8. DELIVERY.</strong> You will pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering process.

In such event, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the delay and keep you informed of the revised delivery schedule.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          Arco Innovation’s delivery terms are F.O.B Arco Innovation’s warehouse. Separate charges for shipping and handling will be shown on the invoice(s). Arco Innovation will ship with the carrier of their choice and use their standard shipping rates.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          Shipment schedules are approximate only and are as accurate as present conditions permit. Arco Innovation assumes no responsibility or liability for failure or delay in making delivery or otherwise performing hereunder when such failure or delay is due to any cause beyond its control and without its fault or negligence. Delivery to a common carrier shall constitute delivery to Buyer and all risk of loss or damage in transit shall be borne by Buyer. If because of Buyer's inability to take delivery, the materials or equipment are not shipped or returned, Arco Innovation may have them stored for Buyer at Buyer's expense, risk and account, and for all other purposes they shall be considered \"shipped.\" Arco Innovation may make partial deliveries which Buyer shall accept and pay for at the prices quoted by Arco Innovation in writing. If any part of the order is not delivered by Arco Innovation or is not in accordance with the order, the remainder of the order and Buyer's obligation thereunder shall not be affected.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>9. EXCUSABLE DELAY, INABILITY TO SUPPLY AND/OR LIMITED SUPPLY.</strong> Neither Arco Innovation nor Buyer shall be liable for failure to perform (except for payment by Buyer for Product(s) received) if performance is prevented, restricted, or interfered with by reason of fire or earthquake or other casualty or accident; inability to procure materials, power, or supplies; war, terrorism, or other violence; any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, or requirement of any government agency, court, or intergovernmental body; situation in which Arco Innovation has insufficient capacity to manufacture or deliver forecasted demand across any and all product lines; environmental, health, safety, or regulatory reason as reasonably determined by Arco Innovation; or any other event or condition whatsoever beyond its reasonable control. A party, when so affected and upon giving notice, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference; provided that the affected party shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such reason for non-performance and shall promptly resume performance if and when such reason is remedied. In the event of back-order or other limited supply or availability of product(s) for such reason or any other reason, Arco Innovation reserves the right, in its sole discretion and in a manner that it determines to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances, to allocate production capacity related to and/or supply of product(s).\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>10. PACKAGING.</strong> All items sold hereunder shall be packed and shipped in accordance with Arco Innovation's best judgment.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>11. INSPECTION. </strong> Buyer shall inspect all items upon arrival and give written notice to Arco Innovation within ten (10) days of arrival of any claim for shortage or nonconformance with these terms. Failure to give such notice, Buyer waives all claims for such shortage or nonconformance, and Buyer shall be bound to accept and pay for all items in accordance with these terms.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>12. RETURNS. </strong> OUR RETURN POLICY IS IN ADDITION TO ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER LAW. WE WILL ACCEPT ANY ITEMS RETURNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR RETURN POLICY DESCRIBED ON OUR RETURN POLICY AND LIMITED WARRANTY TERMS. WE MAY DENY ANY RETURN IF IT FAILS TO MEET OUR RETURN CRITERIA DESCRIBED IN OUR RETURN POLICY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR RETURN PROCESS AND POLICY, PLEASE VISIT OUR RETURN POLICY AND LIMITED WARRANTY TERMS.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          No product may be returned without Arco Innovation's prior written approval. Transportation charges are to be prepaid by Buyer.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>13. PAYMENT.</strong> The Site gives you different payment options using a PCI compliant Third-Party gateway. We reserve the right to change our payment options at any time and for any reason. Payment must be received by us before our acceptance of an order. When you provide credit card information or other information necessary to facilitate payment to us or our vendors, you represent to us that (i) you are the authorized user of the credit card that is used to pay for the Products and Services, (ii) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes, if any, regardless of the amount quoted on the Site at the time of your order.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, you will reimburse us and our vendors or agents for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses. Credits or refunds will be made to the same method of payment and account used to place the order.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>14. TAXES.</strong> Buyer shall pay all sales, use, excise, value added or other similar taxes that may levied, assessed or otherwise become due on account of items to be delivered hereunder, unless proof of exemption is furnished to Arco Innovation. If applicable, a separate charge for taxes will be itemized on the check-out page and invoice.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>International Customers:</strong> Arco Innovation is not responsible for any brokerage, customs fees, or country taxes. The actual value of all orders is indicated on the invoice, and restatements using lower values are not permitted.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>15. REPAIRS, ALTERATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.</strong>  If Buyer requests that Arco Innovation repair any Arco Innovation product not covered by the warranty provided in Section 16 below, such repair charges shall be at the Buyer’s expense unless specifically authorized in writing by Arco Innovation. Any alterations or modifications to the Arco Innovation product by Buyer or Buyer’s agents will void the warranty and render the products nonreturnable by Buyer.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>16. WARRANTY. </strong> Arco Innovation warrants that Arco Innovation products will meet the applicable Arco Innovation product specification at the time Arco Innovation ships the product. If Arco Innovation product packaging includes a specific warranty period, Arco Innovation warrants that products will conform to those written specifications set forth in Arco Innovation’s product literature and/or on Arco Innovation packaging and labeling materials for such products for the time period specified in such literature and materials; provided, however, that products are installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with written instructions furnished by Arco Innovation. Arco Innovation shall have no obligation under this warranty with respect to Arco Innovation products that have been incorrectly installed, improperly maintained, or modified or damaged through misuse, abuse, accident, neglect, or mishandling by Buyer or third parties. Arco Innovation's sole liability and Buyer’s sole remedy under this warranty shall be, at Arco Innovation’s sole option, for Arco Innovation to either repair or replace any product which, having been returned, transportation charges prepaid, has been inspected and determined by Arco Innovation to be defective, or to refund the purchase price paid by Buyer for such defective product. All warranty claims must be made in writing to Arco Innovation prior to the end of the applicable warranty time period.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          THE ABOVE WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY AND CONDITION, AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. </strong>Under no circumstances shall Arco Innovation be liable to Buyer or any third party for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, business, or revenue, arising out of or as a result of Arco Innovation’s provision of products hereunder, including but not limited to product defects or product failure, even if Arco Innovation has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Arco Innovation’s liability for direct damages will in no event exceed the price paid by the Buyer for the Arco Innovation product(s) giving rise to Buyer’s claim for damages.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>18. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.</strong> Buyer represents, warrants, and covenants that buyer and its affiliates, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, subcontractors, consultants, and representatives (collectively referred to as “Representatives”) will perform all of buyer’s obligations under these terms in compliance with all local, state, provincial, national, and international statutes, rulings, regulations, ordinances, and governmental directives, including, without limitation, those pertaining to anti-bribery (example: U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act), money laundering, competition, regulation of trade, the environment, transportation, safety, health, and employment (collectively referred to as \"Laws\") that apply to Arco Innovation, buyer, either party’s business, and the Arco Innovation products and/or services to which these terms relate. Buyer further represents and warrants that neither it nor its Representatives will take any action that might cause Arco Innovation to violate any Law. Buyer will advise Arco Innovation immediately if it learns, or has any reason to know, of (i) any violation of any Law by buyer or its Representatives that occurred or may have occurred in performing buyer’s obligations under these terms or (ii) any failure of buyer or any of its Representatives to comply with buyer’s obligations under this section.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>19. TRADEMARKS. </strong> Buyer acknowledges and agrees that “Arco” and any other trademarks of Arco Innovation (“Arco Marks”) and associated goodwill are Arco Innovation’s exclusive property. By selling products to Buyer, Arco Innovation does not grant Buyer any right to use Arco Marks in connection with the resale of the products unless expressly permitted in writing by Arco Innovation. Buyer will not, at any time, contest the validity of any Arco Mark, claim any rights in any Arco Mark or do anything which, in Arco Innovation's opinion, might disparage, confuse or lessen the significance of any Arco Mark.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>20. BUYER WARRANTIES.</strong> If Buyer makes any express or implied warranties regarding Arco Innovation products (or regarding Buyer products into which Arco Innovation products are incorporated) that differ from the warranties offered by Arco Innovation as set forth in Section 16 above, Buyer shall assume full responsibility for and indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Arco Innovation, and Arco Innovation’s affiliates, successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees and agents from any liability, loss, damage, claim, lien, judgment, and cost, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses, related to any such warranties and/or remedies offered by Buyer.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>21. INDEMNIFICATION. </strong> Buyer indemnifies Arco Innovation, its affiliates, and their employees and agents (the \"Indemnified Parties\") for, and will defend them against, any claim, personal injury, sickness, death, liability, loss, damage, lien, judgment, and cost, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses (collectively referred to as “Loss”) in any way related to (a) any alleged express or implied warranty by Buyer or any party to whom Buyer sells, gives or otherwise transfers Products or a product of Buyer’s into which Products are incorporated that differs from Arco Innovation’s published warranties and (b) any claim related to the use, packaging, labeling, handling, testing, marketing or sale of Products or a product of Buyer’s into which Products are incorporated, except where Products are shown not to meet the then-current published specification.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>22. GENERAL. </strong> (a) Buyer will offer nothing of value to any government official on behalf of Arco Innovation.
