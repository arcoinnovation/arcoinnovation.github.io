In the event of back-order or other limited supply or availability of product(s) for such reason or any other reason, Arco Innovation reserves the right, in its sole discretion and in a manner that it determines to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances, to allocate production capacity related to and/or supply of product(s). \r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>8.

Arco Innovation shall have no obligation under this warranty with respect to Arco Innovation products that have been incorrectly installed, improperly maintained, or modified or damaged through misuse, abuse, accident, neglect, or mishandling by Buyer or third parties. Arco Innovation's sole liability and Buyer’s sole remedy under this warranty shall be, at Arco Innovation’s sole option, for Arco Innovation to either repair or replace any product which, having been returned, transportation charges prepaid, has been inspected and determined by Arco Innovation to be defective, or to refund the purchase price paid by Buyer for such defective product.

Arco Innovation’s liability for direct damages will in no event exceed the price paid by the Buyer for the Arco Innovation product(s) giving rise to Buyer’s claim for damages. \r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>16.

Buyer will advise Arco Innovation immediately if it learns, or has any reason to know, of (i) any violation of any Law by buyer or its Representatives that occurred or may have occurred in performing buyer’s obligations under these terms or (ii) any failure of buyer or any of its Representatives to comply with buyer’s obligations under this section.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>17. TRADEMARKS. </strong>Buyer acknowledges and agrees that “Arco” and any other trademarks of Arco Innovation (“Arco Marks”) and associated goodwill are Arco Innovation’s exclusive property. By selling products to Buyer, Arco Innovation does not grant Buyer any right to use Arco Marks in connection with the resale of the products unless expressly permitted in writing by Arco Innovation. Buyer will not, at any time, contest the validity of any Arco Mark, claim any rights in any Arco Mark or do anything which, in Arco Innovation's opinion, might disparage, confuse or lessen the significance of any Arco Mark.  \r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>18.

The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods will not govern these Terms and Conditions.  A party's failure to require strict performance of these Terms and Conditions in one or more circumstances will not be a waiver of that party's right subsequently to require strict performance under these Terms and Conditions.  The parties hereto confirm that it is their express wish that these Terms and Conditions as well as all other documents relating to these Terms and Conditions, including notices, be drawn up in English only.  Les parties aux présentes confirment que c'est leur volonté que la présente convention de même que tous les documents, y compris les avis, s’y rattachant, soient redigés en anglais seulement.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <strong>  </strong>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n\r\n          If you have any questions about thes terms, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:support@arcoinnovation.com\">support@arcoinnovation.com</a> \r\n          </FeatureText>\r\n        </FeatureItem>             \r\n      </FeaturesGrid>\r\n    </StyledContainer>\r\n  </Section>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Features\r\n\r\nconst mystyle = {\r\n    width: \"150px\",\r\n    height: \"10px\",\r\n    display: \"inline-block\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mystyleBox = {\r\n    padding: '10px',\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst StyledContainer = styled(Container)`\r\nmargin: 80px auto;\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst SectionTitle = styled.h3`\r\n  color: ${props => props.theme.color.primary};\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  margin: 0 auto 40px;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Subtitle = styled.h5`\r\n  font-size: 16px;\r\n  color: ${props => props.theme.color.accent};\r\n  letter-spacing: 0px;\r\n  margin-bottom: 12px;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst FeaturesGrid = styled.div`\r\n  max-width: 1200px;\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr;\r\n  margin: 0px auto;\r\n  grid-column-gap: 40px;\r\n  grid-row-gap: 35px;\r\n  @media (max-width: ${props => props.theme.screen.sm}) {\r\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr;\r\n    padding: 0 20px;\r\n  }\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst FeatureItem = styled.div`\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  align-items: center;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst FeatureTitle = styled.h4`\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  color: ${props => props.theme.color.primary};\r\n  letter-spacing: 0px;\r\n  line-height: 30px;\r\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst FeatureText = styled.p`\r\n  text-align: justify;\r\n`\r\nconst JumpTo = styled.div`\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  background-color: rgb(211,211,211);\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  align-items: center;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n`\r\n","import React from \"react\"\r\nimport Layout from \"../components/common/layout/layout\"\r\nimport SEO from \"../components/common/layout/seo\"\r\nimport Sub_Navigation from \"../components/common/navigation/sub_navigation\"\r\nimport Policy from \"../components/sections/terms\"\r\n\r\n\r\nconst TermsPage = () => (\r\n    <Layout>\r\n    <SEO title=\"Terms\" />\r\n    <Sub_Navigation />\r\n    <Policy />\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default TermsPage"],"sourceRoot":""}
