EXCUSABLE DELAY, INABILITY TO SUPPLY AND/OR LIMITED SUPPLY.</strong> Neither Arco Innovation nor Buyer shall be liable for failure to perform (except for payment by Buyer for Product(s) received) if performance is prevented, restricted, or interfered with by reason of fire or earthquake or other casualty or accident; inability to procure materials, power, or supplies; war, terrorism, or other violence; any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, or requirement of any government agency, court, or intergovernmental body; situation in which Arco Innovation has insufficient capacity to manufacture or deliver forecasted demand across any and all product lines; environmental, health, safety, or regulatory reason as reasonably determined by Arco Innovation; or any other event or condition whatsoever beyond its reasonable control. A party, when so affected and upon giving notice, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference; provided that the affected party shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such reason for non-performance and shall promptly resume performance if and when such reason is remedied. In the event of back-order or other limited supply or availability of product(s) for such reason or any other reason, Arco Innovation reserves the right, in its sole discretion and in a manner that it determines to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances, to allocate production capacity related to and/or supply of product(s).<br/><br/><strong>10.

WARRANTY. </strong> Arco Innovation warrants that Arco Innovation products will meet the applicable Arco Innovation product specification at the time Arco Innovation ships the product. If Arco Innovation product packaging includes a specific warranty period, Arco Innovation warrants that products will conform to those written specifications set forth in Arco Innovation’s product literature and/or on Arco Innovation packaging and labeling materials for such products for the time period specified in such literature and materials; provided, however, that products are installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with written instructions furnished by Arco Innovation. Arco Innovation shall have no obligation under this warranty with respect to Arco Innovation products that have been incorrectly installed, improperly maintained, or modified or damaged through misuse, abuse, accident, neglect, or mishandling by Buyer or third parties. Arco Innovation&#x27;s sole liability and Buyer’s sole remedy under this warranty shall be, at Arco Innovation’s sole option, for Arco Innovation to either repair or replace any product which, having been returned, transportation charges prepaid, has been inspected and determined by Arco Innovation to be defective, or to refund the purchase price paid by Buyer for such defective product. All warranty claims must be made in writing to Arco Innovation prior to the end of the applicable warranty time period.<br/><br/>THE ABOVE WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY AND CONDITION, AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.<br/><br/><strong>17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. </strong>Under no circumstances shall Arco Innovation be liable to Buyer or any third party for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, business, or revenue, arising out of or as a result of Arco Innovation’s provision of products hereunder, including but not limited to product defects or product failure, even if Arco Innovation has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Arco Innovation’s liability for direct damages will in no event exceed the price paid by the Buyer for the Arco Innovation product(s) giving rise to Buyer’s claim for damages.<br/><br/><strong>18. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.</strong> Buyer represents, warrants, and covenants that buyer and its affiliates, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, subcontractors, consultants, and representatives (collectively referred to as “Representatives”) will perform all of buyer’s obligations under these terms in compliance with all local, state, provincial, national, and international statutes, rulings, regulations, ordinances, and governmental directives, including, without limitation, those pertaining to anti-bribery (example: U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act), money laundering, competition, regulation of trade, the environment, transportation, safety, health, and employment (collectively referred to as &quot;Laws&quot;) that apply to Arco Innovation, buyer, either party’s business, and the Arco Innovation products and/or services to which these terms relate. Buyer further represents and warrants that neither it nor its Representatives will take any action that might cause Arco Innovation to violate any Law. Buyer will advise Arco Innovation immediately if it learns, or has any reason to know, of (i) any violation of any Law by buyer or its Representatives that occurred or may have occurred in performing buyer’s obligations under these terms or (ii) any failure of buyer or any of its Representatives to comply with buyer’s obligations under this section.<br/><br/><strong>19. TRADEMARKS. </strong> Buyer acknowledges and agrees that “Arco” and any other trademarks of Arco Innovation (“Arco Marks”) and associated goodwill are Arco Innovation’s exclusive property. By selling products to Buyer, Arco Innovation does not grant Buyer any right to use Arco Marks in connection with the resale of the products unless expressly permitted in writing by Arco Innovation. Buyer will not, at any time, contest the validity of any Arco Mark, claim any rights in any Arco Mark or do anything which, in Arco Innovation&#x27;s opinion, might disparage, confuse or lessen the significance of any Arco Mark.<br/><br/><strong>20. BUYER WARRANTIES.</strong> If Buyer makes any express or implied warranties regarding Arco Innovation products (or regarding Buyer products into which Arco Innovation products are incorporated) that differ from the warranties offered by Arco Innovation as set forth in Section 16 above, Buyer shall assume full responsibility for and indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Arco Innovation, and Arco Innovation’s affiliates, successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees and agents from any liability, loss, damage, claim, lien, judgment, and cost, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses, related to any such warranties and/or remedies offered by Buyer.<br/><br/><strong>21. INDEMNIFICATION. </strong> Buyer indemnifies Arco Innovation, its affiliates, and their employees and agents (the &quot;Indemnified Parties&quot;) for, and will defend them against, any claim, personal injury, sickness, death, liability, loss, damage, lien, judgment, and cost, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses (collectively referred to as “Loss”) in any way related to (a) any alleged express or implied warranty by Buyer or any party to whom Buyer sells, gives or otherwise transfers Products or a product of Buyer’s into which Products are incorporated that differs from Arco Innovation’s published warranties and (b) any claim related to the use, packaging, labeling, handling, testing, marketing or sale of Products or a product of Buyer’s into which Products are incorporated, except where Products are shown not to meet the then-current published specification.<br/><br/><strong>22. GENERAL. </strong> (a) Buyer will offer nothing of value to any government official on behalf of Arco Innovation. (b) Arco Innovation is not responsible for typographical errors made in any of its publications or for clerical errors made in preparation of quotations, sales orders, or acknowledgments. All such errors are subject to correction by Arco Innovation. (c) These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Buyer submits to the exclusive personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the Ontario courts to resolve any disputes arising hereunder. (d) These Terms and Conditions, along with Arco Innovation’s quotation or proposal, contain the parties’ entire understanding on this subject, superseding any prior written or oral agreements, statements, communications or understandings between the parties relating to this subject matter. The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods will not govern these Terms and Conditions. A party&#x27;s failure to require strict performance of these Terms and Conditions in one or more circumstances will not be a waiver of that party&#x27;s right subsequently to require strict performance under these Terms and Conditions. The parties hereto confirm that it is their express wish that these Terms and Conditions as well as all other documents relating to these Terms and Conditions, including notices, be drawn up in English only. Les parties aux présentes confirment que c&#x27;est leur volonté que la présente convention de même que tous les documents, y compris les avis, s’y rattachant, soient redigés en anglais seulement.<br/><br/><strong></strong><br/><br/>If you have any questions about thes terms, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@arcoinnovation.com">support@arcoinnovation.com</a></p></div></div></div></section></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/terms/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-79a26cd946a338906839.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-1e93cbcc238fecaf9a8d.js"],"component---src-pages-about-js":["/component---src-pages-about-js-1526bcac3524d001a595.js"],"component---src-pages-compatibility-js":["/component---src-pages-compatibility-js-042e496c85a6caf367f5.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-c98dcc1a233ce62a0aa2.js"],"component---src-pages-instructions-js":["/component---src-pages-instructions-js-9d93a6925b5b16306bf8.js"],"component---src-pages-integrations-js":["/component---src-pages-integrations-js-2756c439cfa39981d90c.js"],"component---src-pages-privacy-js":["/component---src-pages-privacy-js-46b396cdf3c9cf308340.js"],"component---src-pages-service-js":["/component---src-pages-service-js-c294f70c7f0fbc153b7a.js"],"component---src-pages-terms-js":["/component---src-pages-terms-js-cb742d960248c048cc8d.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/component---src-pages-terms-js-cb742d960248c048cc8d.js" async=""></script><script src="/e46d1b4c4ce3f850f7e4c08e3311f7e0d9f7db3b-6089f99a13600b4eb7c2.js" async=""></script><script src="/commons-0e53af98e176cd273643.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-9b6f388623a2ec93d35f.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-79a26cd946a338906839.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-d9760d5f29a556096c12.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-160f7d8fc5b538626405.js" async=""></script></body></html>
